                <h2>Research Assisant <br>(May 2023 - Present)</h2>
                <p>I am currently working in the MEMS &amp; Autonomous Integrated Microsystems Laboratory at the University of Cincinnati,
                    as an Undergraduate Research Assistant, where I am actively collaborating with a diverse team of Ph.D., Graduate, and Undergraduate students to contribute to various aspects of our projects.
                     I am responsible for the development and modification of PCB plate assemblies, micromachined sensors, and circuitry, alongside engaging in documentation and revision work.
                      My collaborative efforts extend to the assembly of machinery, resulting in a remarkable 60% improvement in overall device production efficiency, showcasing the impact of my contributions.
                       In addition to my work on hardware, I demonstrated proficiency in software development by programming a web server for an ESP-32 board using C++, MicroPython, HTML, and JavaScript. 
                       This application facilitates user input for initial and final voltage parameters with a specified ramp time in a high voltage DC circuit. 
                       Furthermore, I am actively participating in the prototyping and testing of miniature pumps, evaluating sensor performances, and calculating flow rates and humidity levels for applications in biomedical devices, wearable healthcare devices, and smart medical tools.

                <h2> Peer-Teaching Assistant <br>(Jan 2024 - Present)</h2>
                <p>I am currently working as an ENED Peer-Teaching Assistant, where my role encompasses a diverse array of responsibilities aimed at fostering an enriched learning environment.
                     In my capacity, I actively engage with students during assigned sections, providing assistance as they navigate through in-class activities.
                      Additionally, I lead Peer Mentoring sessions, facilitating collaborative learning experiences.
                       To ensure effective support, I diligently participate in weekly training sessions, equipping myself for the challenges and opportunities of the forthcoming week. 
                       Preparation is key, and I dedicate time to solving in-class activities before each session, ensuring a thorough understanding to aid student comprehension.
                    Collaboration is at the core of my responsibilities as I collaborate with a team of three Peer-Teaching Assistants to meticulously grade all assignments within the assigned class. Furthermore, my involvement extends to participating in exam grading sessions and project demonstrations, contributing to the overall assessment process. Beyond the classroom, I extend my assistance to students through organized tutoring sessions, ensuring their holistic academic growth. Through this multifaceted role, I am committed to enhancing the educational experience for both myself and the students I support.</p>

                <h2>Research Volunteer <br> (April - June 2023)</h2>
                <p>In my role as a Research Volunteer, I had the privilege of contributing to two research laboratories, each pushing the boundaries of technology and human-machine interaction. 
                    The first, the "Machine Errors in Affect-Aware Cyber-Human Systems Laboratory," immersed me in the evaluation of computer algorithms adept at dynamically adjusting task difficulty based on physiological indicators.
                     From monitoring respiration, heart rate, sweat, to eye movements, we explored the intricate interplay between human affect and algorithmic responsiveness, enhancing adaptability within cyber-human systems.
                      Transitioning to the "Motor Learning for Robot-Aided Arm Rehabilitation Laboratory," my focus shifted to unraveling the complexities of human motor learning in varied robot-aided scenarios.
                       Utilizing collaborative learning, we employed a 2D labyrinth game and target tracking to gauge the efficacy of rehabilitation approaches, contributing valuable insights to optimize robot-aided motor learning and advance strategies for improved rehabilitation outcomes. 
                       These experiences not only broadened my interdisciplinary research prowess but also underscored the pivotal role of technology in shaping the future of human-machine symbiosis.</p>
